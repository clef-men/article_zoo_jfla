\section{Conclusion and future work}

The development of \Zoo is still ongoing.
It supports a limited fragment of \OCaml that is sufficient for most of our needs.
Its main weakness so far is its memory model, which is sequentially consistent as opposed to the relaxed \OCaml~5 memory model.

\Zoo is not yet available on \texttt{opam} but can be installed and used in other \Coq projects.
We provide a \href{https://github.com/clef-men/zoo_demo}{minimal example} demonstrating its use.
We are also working on integrating \texttt{ocaml2zoo} with \texttt{dune}.
